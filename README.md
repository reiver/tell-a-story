# Tell A Story

Tell a story!

If you want to make it more likely people will pay attention to you, will stay engaged while you are talking them, and will remember what you said to them, **tell a story!**

Whether you are giving a talk at a meetup, pitching your would-be startup to investors, presenting at a conference, vlogging, or trying to change the opinions of others, **tell a story!**

There is something about the human mind that makes it receptive to stories and narratives.

So **tell a story!** ðŸ™‚


## Preamble

But before I offer some advice on _how_ you can go about _telling a story_, let me _tell you a story_ of my own.

This is a story about how I came to realize just how important **telling a story** can be.

Â¶

I started going to meetups in back in 2011.

I started organizing meetups 2012.

Â¶

I loved attending meetups. Many of them were like mini- conferences.

And, at least at that point in my career, I really enjoyed going to conferences.

At the meetups I attended, I got to listen to someone talk about an interested topics.
I got to have interesting discussions with people after the talk.
And many of us would often go to a restaurant afterwards, and eat, drink, and have more interesting discussions.

I made a number of friends, over the years, by going to and being active in meetups.

Â¶

Early on when I started attending meetups I probably went to too many ðŸ™‚ At that time, I was attending around 4 to 6 meetups a week. Somtimes I even attended multiple meetups in one evening! ðŸ™‚

I eventually got that under control, and reduced how many meetups I attended a week to a more manageable amount ðŸ™‚

Although before that happened, I started organizing meetups.

Â¶

Because my background is very technical, many of the meetups I attended have been technical.

Because my background is very technical, many of the meetups I organized have been technical.

First I started organizing meetups on machine learning & artificial intelligence. And then data science. Then behavioral sciences. Then fintech. And so on, and so on. Etc, etc.

Â¶

There are many different popular formats for meetups.

Some are talks. (These are similar to talks one might be exposed to at a conference.)

Some are reading groups. (Reading scholarly papers. Reading books. Reading blog posts.)

Some are purely socials. (You meetup, often in a restaurant. Eat, drink, talk, and socialize. In a city where _â€˜who you knowâ€™_ (and â€˜would you don't knowâ€™) can affect your career, these social meetups can be good to attend, as they help you _know_ more people.)

I've organized all 3 of these types of meetups. (As well as meetups with formats different than these. Ex: hackathons, panels, courses, etc.)

Â¶

The talks I have organized over the years have tended to attract hundreds of people to attend and fill up the room to capacity. We actually had to prevent (extra) people from coming in, else we would have been in violation of the fire code (for the room).

Before I started organizing meetups, it wasn't obvious to me how I would find speakers to give talks at the meetups.

After I had been organizing for a while I realized that, to get speakers, you just go ask people if they would be interested in giving a talk.
Although, after the meetups I organized gained some popularity, I would get individuals approaching me, asking if they could give a talk.
But still, usually, _you_ have to go and ask people if they would be interested in giving a talk.

Â¶

Most of these talks have been on highly technical topics.

(Things such as _artificial intelligence_, _machine learning_, _bayesian statistics_, _data science_, _computer science_, and _software engineering_.)

I've seen â€˜goodâ€™ talks. And I've seen â€˜badâ€™ talks.

**And often the difference between the â€˜goodâ€™ talks and â€˜badâ€™ talks wasn't the technical material.**

**It was how the material was delivered.**

(And yes, we are getting to the â€˜tell a storyâ€™ part ðŸ™‚)

Â¶

What I noticed is thisâ€¦.

**If (when giving a technical talk) you just listed out a bunch of facts, the audience will tend to get bored, many will start looking at their phones (and going on the Internet), and they won't remember most (if any) of what you told them.**

**But if you tell and story, and tell the same facts as part of the story, then the audience tends to pay attention, tends to stay engaged, and tends to remember what you said.**

So **tell a story!** ðŸ™‚

Â¶

**What is interesting (to me) is that many of these stories (that were told for technical talks during these technical meetups) had a very similar pattern.**

The low resolution struture of the story many of these speakers told was:

> I had a problem.
>
> I first tried this to solve the problem like this, but failed.
>
> I then tried to solve the problem this other other way, and succeeded.

Â¶

There is something about the human mind that makes it receptive to stories.

This applies to technical talks. But also to non-technical fields too, and to things that aren't talks.



## One Type Of Story

If you have been telling stories for a while, you probably don't even have to intentionally think about _how_ to tell a story.

For the experienced story teller, it is probably very automatic, very unconscious, and very inarticulate.

If you have been telling stories for a while, it is probably like walking, or seeing, or driving.

(If you are an adult, you don't have to consciously think about how to do those things; you just _do them_ (without having to deliberately think about them).)

Â¶

**But if you have not been telling stories for a while, then it can be useful to use a framework to create your story.**

There are different types of stories.

But here is one type of story.

**The frame of this type of story is made up of 4 things:**

* a **character**,
* one or more things that the _character_ **wants**,
* **obstacles** that are in the way of and keeping the _character_ from getting what they _want_, and
* a **transformation** (of the _character_) as a result of overcoming the _obstacles_, regardless of whether the _character_ gets what they _want_ or not.

So let's say that againâ€¦.

A **character** **wants** something.
The **character** overcomes **obstacles** to try to get what they **want**.
The **character** ends up **transformed** as a result, regardless of whether the **character** gets what they **want** or not.

And let's say that yet againâ€¦.

**What does your character want?**
**What does your character need to overcome to get it?**
**And how has trying to overcome those things changed your character?**

(Remember, the _character_ can be you. This can be a _true story_.)

(Or the _character_ can be someone else.)

(Or the _character_ can even be fictional and made up.)

Â¶

If you are trying to tell a story about yourself or your own life, some questions you can ask yourself, to put your story into this framework, is:

* who are we?
* what do we want?
* what is standing in our way?

Asking yourself those questions, can be a useful place to start, when trying to construct the story you will tell.

Â¶

If you think back to the structure of the story told during the meetup talks, it fits this pattern:

> I had a problem.
>
> I first tried this to solve the problem like this, but failed.
>
> I then tried to solve the problem this other other way, and succeeded.

Â¶

In the technical talks, the character is real.

But the character can be fictional too.

The story doesn't even have to be factually accurate. It can even be completely made up.

There is something about the human mind that makes it receptive to stories and narratives.
And it doesn't seem to matter if the story is â€˜realâ€™ or not.


## Meaningful Stories

Of course, just _telling a story_ is no guarantee of success.

The story also has to have meaning to the whomever you are telling it to.

Â¶

Saying what you want to say in terms of a _story_ will help keep your audience.
So _telling a story_ is important.

But the content of your story is something orthogonal to this, that matters too.

For example, talking about _the history of typewriters_ to a bunch of _cooks_ will probably eventually bore them, no matter how good of a story you tell.
It is probably not something they care about.

Â¶

_Content_ without _story_ is not enough.

_Story_ without _content_ (your audience cares about) is not enough.

**Both** _content_ and _story_ matter.


## Story Arc

An additional framework that can be useful (**to use with the previous framwork**) is the **story arc**.

A useful structure for a story arc has 3 components:

* a **beginning**,
* a **middle**, and
* an **end**.

In terms of your **character** (whether that _character_ is you, is someone else, or is fictional), you can ask yourself:

* where does your character begin?
* what's the middle?
* where does your character end up?


## Multiple Levels Of Stories and Story Arc

If you are creating a course, or a vlogging, you can have stories and story arcs at multiple levels.

More specifically, you can have **intra-episode** stories and story arcs, and **inter-episode** stories and story arcs.

(Let me explain what those mean.)

Each episode of a vlog should have its own self-contained story.
(I.e., an intra-episode story and story arc.)

But, across many episodes there can be another (different) story too.
(I.e., an inter-episode story and story arc.)

An example of this latter story and story arc (i.e., of this inter-episode story and story arc) are
the long stories told in television (TV) shows across multiple episodes in a season.

If you are a vlogger (where a â€˜seasonâ€™ wouldn't be defined quite the same way), a _â€˜seasonâ€™_ could be related to life events.

For example, trying to create a company.
Or, you or your wife getting pregnant and (eventually) giving birth to your child.
Or, your journey through school.
Etc.


## Monomyth / Hero's Journey

The previous story type we described was:â€¦.

A **character** **wants** something.
The **character** overcomes **obstacles** to try to get what they **want**.
The **character** ends up **transformed** as a result, regardless of whether the **character** gets what they **want** or not.

Orthogonal to this, we also talked about the story arc consisting of:

* a **beginning**,
* a **middle**, and
* an **end**.

Another story framework that is similar, but more restrictive, to all that is called the **monomyth** or **hero's journey**.

(Note that _not all stories_ have to be a monomyth / hero's journey.
You can tell other types of stories.
But it can be useful to be aware of this framework.
And even make use of it sometimes.)

The 3 main stages or _acts_ of the _monomyth_ / _hero's journey_ is:

* the **departure**,
* the **initiation**, and
* the **return**.

The 3 main stages or _acts_ of the _monomyth_ / _hero's journey_ can be sub-divided into sections:

* **departure**
	* ordinary world
	* call to adventure
	* refusal of the call
	* meeting with the mentor
	* crossing the first threshold
* **initiation**
	* tests, allies, enemies
	* approach
	* ordeal
	* reward
* **return**
	* the road back
	* resurrection hero
	* return with elixir

Note that some who have used the _monomyth_ / _hero's journey_ framework do not always use all of these sections.
Sometimes some are skipped, here and there.

(Also note that there are alternate ways of dividing the 3 main stages of the _monomyth_ / _hero's journey_.)

The meanings of these sub-sections are:


| Act        | Section                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| departure  |                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|            | ordinary world               | this is about the hero's or protagonist's or character's normal life, at the start of the story, before the â€˜adventureâ€™ begins.                                                                                                                                                                           |
|            | call to adventure            | this is about the hero or protagonist or character being faced with something that makes them begin their â€˜adventureâ€™. this might be a problem or challenge that needs overcome.                                                                                                                          |
|            | refusal of the call          | this is about the hero or protagonist or character attempting to refuse the â€˜adventureâ€™. maybe because they are afraid. maybe because they have other duties or obligations. maybe because they worry about how much work it will be. maybe because or insecurity. etc.                                   |
|            | meeting with the mentor      | this is about the hero or protagonist or character meeting someone that can ready him for the journey ahead. maybe by providing advice. maybe providing him with something a tool, talismans, artifact, etc that will help the hero or protagonist or character later in their journey.                   |
|            | crossing the first threshold | this is about the hero or protagonist or character, for the first time (during this story), leaving their â€˜ordinary worldâ€™ and â€˜crossing the thresholdâ€™ into â€˜adventureâ€™, (either literally or metaphorically). this could involve danger. this could involve risk. this could involved the unknown. etc. |
| initiation |                              |             |
|            | tests, allies, enemies       |             |
|            | approach                     |             |
